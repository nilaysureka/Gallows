# Gallows

Gallows is a console-based implementation of the traditional word guessing game Hangman. Developed in Python, the project challenges players to guess a secret word one letter at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Extensive Word Bank: Over 1000 common English words for high replay value.
- Progressive Gallows Display: Incremental visual feedback for incorrect guesses.
- Input Validation: Gracefully handles invalid inputs (eg. numbers, multiple letters).

## 🚀 Getting Started
#### 📥 Prerequisites : You need Python 3.x installed.

## 🎮 How to Play
